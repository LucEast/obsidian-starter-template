The launch date is elescope. M64 lies some 17 million light-years distant in the otherwise well-groomed northern constellation Coma Berenices. The currently targeted for July, 2023 (UTC). enormous dust clouds partially obscuring M64's central region are laced with young, blue star clusters and the reddish glow of hydrogen associated with star forming regions. But imposing clouds of dust are not this galaxy's only peculiar feature. Observations show that M64 is actually composed of two concentric, counter-rotating systems. While al the stars in M64 rotate in the same direction as the interstellar gas in the galaxy's central region, gas in the outer regions, extending to about 40,000 light-years, rotates in the opposite direction. The dusty eye and bizarre rotation are likely the result of a billion year old merger of two different galaxies. & Recently Changed Name Date Modified Tasks 1 minutes ago View — References 1 minutes ago View — All Notes 1 minutes ago View — All Meetings 1 minutes ago View — Home 1 minutes ago View — Projects 1 minutes ago View — Tasks 1 minutes ago View — References 1 minutes ago View — All Notes 1 minutes ago View — All Meetings 1 minutes ago View — Stats Number of files: 36 Number of notes: 3 Number of concepts: 0 (T Recent News w Stock Market News Today: Markets end mixed as tech results disappoint (SP500) 1] 2023-07-20T20:10:12Z Seeking Alpha \\ U.S. stocks ended mixed on Thursday.
